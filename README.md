# my_particles.js
Self interpretation and recreation of the particles.js file from scratch. 
The file, like the original particle.js file can be imported into any html file using the following code:
####<script type="text/javascript"> creat_particles(50); </script>
which should be included at the bottom of the file. Each particle is a div element whose position changes constantly and each of which is currently added to the body as their parent node. This can be easily modifid to be added to a different element or to elements of a certain class. 
####home.html is an example file which can be loaded to see how to the my_particles.js file is linked and used.
