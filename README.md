# my_particles.js
1. My interpretation and recreation of the particles.js file from scratch. 
2. This file like the original particle.js file can be imported into any html file using the following code:
>>> <script type="text/javascript"> creat_particles(50) </script> which should be included at the bottom of the file.
3. 50 in the above line is the argument that defines the number of particles and can be take any value. 
4. Each particle is a div element whose position changes constantly and each of which is currently added to the body as their parent node. This can be easily modifid to be added to a different element or to elements of a certain class. 

#### home.html is an example file which can be loaded to see how to the my_particles.js file is linked and used.
